    Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
	
	This assignment applies machine learning  to help Alphabet Soup improve success rate of selecting  applicants whose project  will be successful.
	This is achieved by by reading in a dataset consisting of 34299 rows of  historical applicant data, categorising it, preprocessing it,  performing training and testing of the data and altering  various variables of the analysis.

    Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

    Data Preprocessing
        What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
		The target  is the IS_SUCCESSFUL  column, in which 1 represents success and 0  no success.
        What variable(s) are the features for your model?
		All other data are features, with the exception of EIN and NAME, which  are dropped.
        Those two  exceptions are neither targets nor features.

    Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
        How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
		For initial analysis I  utilised:
		
        Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
        What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

    Summary: Summarise the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
